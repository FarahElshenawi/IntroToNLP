# Intro to NLP Notebooks

This repository contains two notebooks from my **Intro to NLP** course with 365 DataScience. The notebooks focus on essential Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including text preprocessing, tokenization, and classification, demonstrating fundamental NLP operations using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

## Notebooks

### [Text Preprocessing and Classification](link-to-your-github-notebook-1)

- **Description**: This notebook introduces essential NLP preprocessing techniques and explores text classification tasks.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Text Cleaning**: Methods for cleaning text data by converting it to lowercase and removing special characters.
  - **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or sentences using `nltk.tokenize` functions such as `word_tokenize` and `sent_tokenize`.
  - **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms using `PorterStemmer` and `WordNetLemmatizer`.
  - **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)**: Labeling words with their grammatical roles using `pos_tag`.
  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like names, locations, and organizations within text using `ne_chunk`.
  - **Text Classification**: Basic classification techniques with `NaiveBayesClassifier`, useful for categorizing text (e.g., sentiment analysis).
  - **Working with Corpora**: Accessing and using resources such as WordNet, stopwords, and the Gutenberg Corpus.

### [Practical Case Study Notebook](link-to-your-github-notebook-2)

- **Description**: This notebook applies NLP techniques to a practical case study, providing hands-on experience with text data analysis and classification.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-world application of NLP preprocessing techniques.
  - Analysis of textual data to demonstrate the impact of preprocessing on classification outcomes.
